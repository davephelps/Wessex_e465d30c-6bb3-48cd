# Azure Service Bus - Topic Subscription (Azure Logic App Workflow)

For our next lab we will create a new Logic App and workflow to trigger from the Service Bus Topic and subscription created in the previous lab. The new workflow will then fulfil the order by calling a REST API.

## Create an Order Fulfilment Workflow

Create a new Logic App Workspace (this is the same process as [this lab](<../Lab_1_LogicApp Setup/1.1 Create_LogicApp (Standard).md>)) by clicking the Azure extension, then going to *Workspaces*. Click the Logic App icon and select *Create new Logic App Workspace* (follow the wizard to also create a new stateful workflow). Use the following settings:

- Workspace name - "Fulfilment_Workspace"
- Logic App - *ContosoFulfilment*
- Workflow - *FulfilOrder* (Stateful)

## Add Service Bus topic Trigger

We now need to trigger our workflow from the Azure Service Bus topic created in the previous lab. Add an *In App* Azure Service Bus trigger (remember there are two types of connector, *In App* and *Shared*. *In App* run locally with the Logic App, *Shared* do not and have throttling limits and cannot use private networking). Select the trigger operation called *When messages are available in a topic*.

You will need to add a new connection with the same settings used in the first Logic App and select the *ordertopic* topic and the *orderTopicSubscription* subscription:

To test the trigger, we need to ensure no other projects are running locally. If an error is displayed about a port being in-use, open a cmd prompt and run the following to stop any running instances.

``` c#
taskkill /im func.exe /f
```

Run the Logic App locally and use RestClient to trigger the *CreateOrder* workflow **in Azure** to send a message to the topic. Go to the local run history of the FulfilOrder workflow to see if the FulfilOrder workflow has triggered, for example:

![Run History](<images/Workflow - Service Bus Trigger Run History.png>)

## Call a REST API to Fulfil the Order

Once the workflow has been triggered, we need to call an internal API to fulfil the order.

In this case however, the API we are calling accepts an HTTP POST only, and we will be passing the entire payload, where previously we were using an HTTP GET and passing the email address as a path parameter.

### Add an HTTP Action

Use the Logic Apps visual designer to add a new HTTP action immediately after the *Parse Order Request* action. The process is very similar to that of the account API, detailed [here](<../Lab_3_Logic App Workflows/3.1 Call a REST API.md>), but using an HTTP POST instead of a GET.

Use the following settings:
- Action name *Call Fulfil API*
- URI - add an app setting in *local.settings.json* called *fulfilAPI* and set it to the URL provided by the trainer
- Headers 
    - *Content-Type* and a value of *application/json*
    - *Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key* - add an app setting in *local.settings.json* called *fulfilAPIKey* and set it to the key provided by the trainer

- Body - use the data picker and select *Content* from the service bus trigger:


    ![Fulfil API](<images/Workflow - Fulfil API Body.png>) 


## Test the API Call

Run the project locally and use RestClient to trigger the *CreateOrder* workflow **in Azure**. Go to the local run history of the FulfilOrder workflow to see if the FulfilOrder workflow has triggered and the HTTP call to *FilfilOrder* was successful. View the response output in the run history - the following should be returned:

![Run History](<images/Workflow - Service Bus Trigger Run History 2.png>)

## Add Parse JSON Action

As we've done previously, in order to make the request payload fields available in the visual designer, add a *ParseJSON* action and use [this file](<../Common Files/sample_request/internalOrderSourceMessage.json>) as the sample payload to create the schema.

## Deploy to Azure

Ensure the local project is not running, then deploy the FulfilOrder Logic App to Azure (refer to [Deploy to Azure](<../Lab_4_Deploy to Azure/4.1 Deploy to Azure.md>)) for a reminder on how to do this, but **do not create a new plan**.

Use the following settings:
- Name, enter a unique name as the Logic App needs to be globally unique
- Location - set to North Europe
- Hosting Plan - use the plan created in [Deploy to Azure](<../Lab_4_Deploy to Azure/4.1 Deploy to Azure.md>)
- Resource Group - set the resource group you have been allocated 
- Storage Account - create a new storage account
- Application Insights - use the Application Insights resource previously created

## Test in Azure

Use RestClient to trigger the *CreateOrder* workflow **in Azure**, then go to the run history of the FulfilOrder workflow also in Azure to see if the FulfilOrder workflow has triggered and the HTTP call to *FilfilOrder* was successful. View the response output in the run history.
