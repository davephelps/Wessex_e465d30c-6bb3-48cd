# SQL Connector

For our next lab, we will write the output of the data mapper to a SQL database.

If the Azure SQL Database exists already, or you have been provided details by your trainer, please ignore the following section *Create a new Azure SQL Database* and move onto *Logic App SQL Connector*.

## Create a new Azure SQL Database
From the Azure Portal, create a new Azure SQL Database by clicking *Create a resource* from the top left menu. Search for Azure SQL Database:

![Azure SQL Database](<./images/Marketplace - SQL.png>)

Configure the following:

- Resource Group - the resource group where the database will be deployed
- Database Name - *ContosoRetail*


Under *Server*, make sure it is configured to create a *new* server. Click *Create New*, then set the Authentication Method to *Use both SQL and Microsoft Entra Authentication*. 

The reason to select two types of authentication is to ensure the function works correctly with the database using standard SQL Authentication before enabling Managed Identity. For a real project, we would only select the *Microsoft Entra Authentication* so we can be sure no connection strings are ever used with our database.

As we have two types of authentication, we need to create two admin accounts:

- Microsoft Entra ID account - click *Set Admin* and select *Microsoft Entra ID*. Use the account used to sign into the Azure Portal
- Azure SQL Database local database account - set the Admin login and password to something you can refer to later

Then configure the following settings.
- Workload environment - *Development*. Setting the Development option selects less powerful compute and other settings more aligned to a development environment

Click *Compute and Storage* to configure the following:
- Service Tier - General Purpose
- Compute Tier - Serverless
- Backup Storage Redundancy - *locally redundant backup storage*. For production scenarios, Zone Redundant or Geo redundant storage should be selected:

Click *Next* to move to Networking and set the following settings:
- Connectivity Method - *Public Endpoint*

- Allow Azure Services to access this server - *Yes* 

Azure SQL Database will require a firewall rule to be configured for client connections, but by setting *Allow Azure Services to access this server* to *Yes*, we will allow Azure deployed services to access the database without an explicit firewall rule. Bear in mind, this is *all* services in Azure. 

If *Add current client IP address* is set to *Yes*, the development machine IP address will be added, allowing for the database to be viewed/updated etc.

Click *Review and Create* to create the Azure SQL Database and Server.

### Create Tables and Stored Procedure

We need to create two tables and one stored procedure:

*Tables*
- ContosoOrder - contains details of the customer and order summary
- ContoslOrderDetails - contains details of each order line

*Stored Procedure*
- CreateOrder - stored procedure to receive a JSON request and write to the two tables above.

There is a SQL script in the repo you can use to create the tables and stored procedure - as mentioned previously, if this has already been done, or a database provided by your trainer, you can ignore this step.

The script is available [here](scripts/sql_objects.sql) - load it into a query editor such as SQL Management Studio (available [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms)), or use the Query Editor (Preview), an option available in the Azure Portal:

![Query Editor](<images/SQL Database Query Editor.png>)

## Logic App SQL Server Connector

Azure Logic Apps has a built-in SQL connector, and a number of other data connectors. Create a new SQL connector directly after the *Create Internal Order* data mapper action by clicking "+" and selecting the SQL Server action.

Note - the SQL Server action can be used for Azure SQL and SQL Server hosted in the cloud, on-premises etc.

Select *Execute query*, and when prompted, add the database connection properties:

- Connection Name - enter *sql_conn*
- Authentication Type - select *Connection String*
- Connection String - copy the connection string by clicking *Connection Strings* in the overview of the Azure SQL Database, then copy the connection string under *ADO.NET (SQL authentication)* as follows:

![Connection String](<images/Azure SQL Database Connection String.png>)

Edit the connection string to add the password created earlier for the administrator account (the username should be present already). Ensure all settings below marked between {} are configured for your database, but **remove the braces** when entering your username and password

``` SQL
Server=tcp:{your server},1433;Initial Catalog=ContosoRetail;Persist Security Info=False;User ID={your username};Password={your_password};MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;
```

Set the action Retries to *None* so the action won't retry during development and name the action *Create Order in SQL*.

For *Query* enter EXEC [dbo].[CreateOrder], then in single quotes, select the *Transformed Output* of the data mapper action. It should look as follows (note the single quotes):

![Stored Procedure](<images/SQL Action - Call Stored Procedure.png>)

Test the workflow and review the run history to check the *Create Order in SQL* action executed successfully. If you have access to the database, check the two tables to verify the data has been written successfully. For example the following is from the Azure Portal *Query Editor*:


*ContosoOrder* table
![Query Editor Data](<images/SQL Database Query Editor (data 1).png>)

*ContosoOrderDetail* table
