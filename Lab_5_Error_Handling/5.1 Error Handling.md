# Error Handling

In this lab we will explore how workflows manage failures, including retries and compensation.

## Retries

All actions have a *Retry* policy, which is configured under *Settings* of the action, for example for the HTTP action:

![HTTP Retry](<images/HTTP - Retry.png>)

Select the Retry Policy to review the different options. The default is to retry 4 times, but can be configured to retry X times at X interval or to retry based on an exponential backoff.

Set the *Retry Policy* to *Fixed Interval*, then set the retry count to 3 and the interval to PT20S, which will result in 3 retries at 20 second intervals. For exponential backoff, see [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/error-exception-handling#retry-policy-limits)

![HTTP Fixed Interval Retry](<images/HTTP Retry - Fixed Internal.png>)

Test this by updating the retry interval to a fixed value and force the HTTP call to fail so we can see the retries occurring. If a connection cannot be established to the API endpoint, a retry will occur and if any of the following status codes are returned by the API, a retry will also occur:

- 408 (Request Timeout)
- 429 (Too Many Requests)
- 500 (Internal Server Error)
- 502 (Bad Gateway)
- 503 (Service Unavailable)
- 504 (Gateway Timeout)

Update the API url in *local.settings.json* to be an invalid host and test the workflow - there should be 3 retries 20 seconds apart, so after 60 seconds the workflow should fail. Review the run history where each retry can be viewed.

In development it is best to set the retry interval to *none* so it fails and returns an error immediately.

## Error Handling

When an action in a workflow fails, by default the workflow will stop execution and show in the run history as *Failed* where we can review the workflow execution. We may however need take some kind of action if the workflow fails, such as writing to an error queue or calling an API. 

All actions have a *depends on* setting, where their execution is based on a dependent action (or actions). We can configure an action to execute if the preceding action is successful, or has failed. For example:

![Depends On](<images/Action - depends on.png>)

We can update the *depends on* setting to select *Failed* so the action will only run if the preceding action has failed.

### Create an Error Handler

Our workflow should look as follows:

![Overview](<images/Workflow - Overview.png>)

We now want to create an exception handler that will run if any action in our workflow fails, then return the failure details  in the response.

While a single action can have an error handler, we can use a *Scope* action which is an action that can contain multiple actions. We can then create a single action, or another scope, that depends on the scope and sets its *depends on* value to *Failed*. This is like using *try* *catch* in C# or Java. 

First, we will add a *scope* action after the *Response variable* action by clicking + and selecting a *Scope* action , as follows (name the scope action *Business Logic*):

![Scope](<images/Workflow - scope.png>)

If we were starting a workflow from scratch, we would create the *Scope* action first, but as we have created our workflow already, drag each action into the scope, starting with the *Check Customer Exists* action, then *Parse Customer Account Response* etc. until all actions are inside the *Business Logic* scope action. 

It's not possible today to multi select actions to copy/cut and paste, so each action needs to be dragged individually. The workflow should now look as follows:

![Scope Actions](<images/Workflow - scope actions.png>)

We now need to add an exception handler - add another *Scope* action directly below the *Business Logic* scope action, name it *Exception Handler* and change the *depends on* to be *Failed*:

![Exception Handler](<images/Workflow - Exception Handler.png>)

To retrieve details of any exceptions that have happened in the *Business Logic* scope, we need to use the *@result()* expression. This expression will return the full list of each action within a scope and whether each action succeeded or failed. Note however, the *result()* expression does not iterate though nested scopes, or conditions - it only reports on actions directly within the scope. In order to include actions that may have failed within the *Does Account Exist* condition, we would also need to include this in the expression.

First, create a *Filter* action within the *Exception Handler* scope. In the *From* field, click the *fx* icon and enter the expression:

```c#
union(result('Does_Account_Exist'),result('Business_Logic'))
```

For the *filter query*, click *fx* again and enter:

```c#
item()?.status
```
Ensure the condition is set to *is equal to* and set the value to *Failed*:

![Filter Failures](<images/Error Handler - Filter Failures.png>)

We now need to add a *Response* action to return the action name that failed and the exception details (remember to click the *fx* icon to add the expressions):

- name - body('Filter_Failures')[0]?.name
- message - coalesce(body('Filter_Failures')[0]?.error?.message, body('Filter_Failures')[0]?.outputs?.body?.message)

The *message* field above is a generic boiler plate expression that will return the error message from any action type that has failed. The reason there are two body expressions are that some actions return a body such as *HTTP* and *SQL* but some do not, such as *Compose*.

![Failure Response](<images/Exception Handler - Failure Response.png>)

Verify the exception hander works by changing the *api_key* in the config to be invalid, such as appending an underscore to the key value so authorisation will fail. Test the workflow, the response should be:

``` json
{
  "name": "Check_Customer_Exists",
  "message": "Access denied due to invalid subscription key. Make sure to provide a valid key for an active subscription."
}
```

Deploy the changes to Azure and validate it works as expected. You will need to edit the *api_key* in *Environment Variables* under *Settings* in the Logic App to set to an invalid key, then test with RestClient.
