# Securing Configuration Settings

## Summary

As we have seen, any Logic App (or indeed any application) will likely need access to other resources, which involves storing secrets in local configuration. This creates a security risk, for example the API Key can be copied or accidentally checked into source control. If the key needs to be updated, it will also involve an update to the application, which is not desirable as it may cause downtime and add risk.

In this lab we will take the Account API url and store in KeyVault. We will then reference it from the Logic App Configuration settings.

## Azure KeyVault

To externalise secrets from applications, we can use Azure KeyVault which securely stores and manages sensitive information such as keys, secrets and certificates.

Using KeyVault offers a number of benefits:

- Reduces the risk of accidental exposure of sensitive data
- Simplifies secure application development by centralising secret management.
- Enables secure integration with Azure services and applications
- Supports regulatory compliance through secure storage and auditing

## KeyVault Configuration

Create an instance of KeyVault in the Standard tier, making sure to select the *Access Configuration Configuration Model* to RBAC (Role Based Access Control). There are two ways to connect to KeyVault - using Managed Identity or using access policies.

### Add Administrator Access
Ensure you add your own identity (the identity used to login to the Azure Portal) to have permission to create and administer secrets by navigating to *Access Control IAM* and adding yourself to the *Key Vault Administrator* role:

![Add Role Assignment](<images/KeyVault - Add Role Assignment.png>)

Click *Next*, but leave *Assign access to* as the default of *User, group or service principal*. Click *Select Members* then search for your own user identity. Press *Select* then press *Review and Assign* twice.

### Create a Secret
Create a new secret by navigating to *Objects* then *Secrets*. Add a new secret by clicking *Generate/Import*. 


![Create Secret](<images/KeyVault - Create Secret.png>)

For the Name set it to *accountAPI* and for the Secret Value set it to the url of the account API (this should already be in the Environment Variables). For example, the environment variable may be called *url* in your Logic App as follows:

![Workflow Environment Variable](<images/Workflow - Environment url setting.png>)

Click *Create* to create the secret.

### Grant Permission to Logic App for Secret

Grant access to allow the Logic App to have read access to the secret by clicking the secret then clicking Access control (IAM) and adding the Logic App Managed Identity as a *Key Vault Secrets User* role:

![Secret Role](<images/KeyVault - Add Role Assingment Secret.png>)

## Logic App Configuration
We now need to obtain a reference to our secret we can use in the Logic App to access the secret. Secrets are *versioned*, so we can reference a specific version, or we can reference the secret such that we will *always* pick up the latest version.

Click on the secret then click the version directly underneath *CURRENT VERSION*, which will load an overview page. The *Secret Identifier* is a unique url to the secret, which includes the version.

To reference the secret explicitly by the version, simply copy the *Secret Identifier* value. To always retrieve the latest version, remove the version from the end of the identifier.

For example, the secret identifier (which includes the version) may be:

https://yourkeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/accountAPI/**d19cddeb69cf4cc0865ac3be28b17546**

To retrieve the latest version, the url would become:
https://yourkeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/accountAPI

Use the format to always retrieve the latest version - copy the secret reference for use in the next section.


### KeyVault References

Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions and Azure App Service support a feature called *KeyVault References*. With KeyVault references, we can securely reference secrets stored in Azure Key Vault directly from our application settings, without exposing sensitive data in configuration files or code:

- Instead of storing secrets (like connection strings, API keys, passwords) directly in application settings, we store them securely in Azure Key Vault.
- The Managed Identity of the Logic App is used to access KeyVault securely
- In application settings, we use a special syntax to reference the secret stored in Key Vault
- The secrets are automatically retrieved from KeyVault at runtime
- This is seamless to our Logic App - it just references the configuration values as normal (@appsetting('url')) and the runtime manages access to KeyVault

### Logic App KeyVault Reference Configuration

Now we need to add a *KeyVault Reference* in our Logic App to read the value from the secret. Navigate to the Logic App, Settings, Environment Variables, then to the configuration item that needs to be protected, for example the *api*.

Paste the secret reference, in the following format:

@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://yourkeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/accountAPI)

When the settings are saved, the setting should be visible as a KeyVault reference with a green tick:

![KeyVault Reference](<images/Logic App - KeyVault Reference.png>)

## Test in Azure

Use RestClient to trigger the *CreateOrder* workflow **in Azure** and validate the Account API  action succeeded. If successful, go to the run history of the FulfilOrder workflow also in Azure to see if the FulfilOrder workflow has triggered and the HTTP call to *FilfilOrder* was successful. View the response output in the run history.

## Additional Lab

We have added the Account API Url, but as an additional lab, try adding the Account API key to KeyVault and configure the KeyVault reference in the Logic App.
