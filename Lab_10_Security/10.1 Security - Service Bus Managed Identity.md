# Authorise to Service Bus with Managed Identity

In this lab we will use Managed Identity to authorise to the Azure Service Bus topic subscription used by the *Contoso Order* Logic App (the first Logic App we created).

The *CreateOrder* workflow uses a connection string currently to connect to Azure Service Bus, and while this works, *Managed Identity* is recommended as best practice.

## Managed Identity

A common challenge for developers is the management of secrets, credentials, certificates, and keys used to secure communication between services. Managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage these credentials.

Here are some of the benefits of using managed identities:

- No need to manage credentials. Credentials arenâ€™t even accessible to you.
- Use Managed Identities to authenticate to any resource that supports Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) authentication, including your own applications
- Managed identities can be used at no extra cost

There are two types of Managed Identity - System Assigned and User Assigned:

- With System Assigned, the Managed Identity is specific to the service using it. For example, if an Azure Logic App were to use Managed Identity to connect to Service Bus, the Managed Identity could *only* be used by that Logic App. If the Logic App is deleted, the Managed Identity is deleted. This does mean there can be no unintended consequences of permissions being added for one application, that becomes available in another.The downside of this approach is that permissions granted to the Managed Identity would need to be added each time the Logic App is created
- User Assigned Managed Identity is created independently of  the Azure Resource that is using it. User Assigned Managed Identity can be created, permissions assigned and can then remain as a separate resource to be used by one or more services. The advantage of User Assigned Managed Identity is the Managed Identity can exist even if the services using it are deleted. Permissions can be granted once, rather than having to potentially apply them multiple times as services are re-created or new ones created.


### Sharing Managed Identities

As mentioned above, User Assigned Managed Identities can by their very nature, be shared between a number of different services. Care should be taken when sharing Managed Identities:

- There can be unintended consequences of identity sharing however. For example, one Azure Logic App could need access to Service Bus and Azure SQL, but another Azure Logic App may only need access to Azure Storage. If we update the User Assigned Managed Identity to have access to all three services, it means both Azure Logic Apps have access services they do not need access to
- Sharing identities can cause not only security risks but also mistakes can happen during configuration where services accidentally access resources they should not be able to
- Think very carefully about the scope of Managed Identities, how they are re-used and the services they have access to
- It can make perfect sense to have a single User Assigned Managed Identity used by a single service as the MI can exist regardless of the Logic App being deleted/re-created. Where organisations have security teams that control resource access, User Assigned Managed Identity is of real benefit

## Service Bus and Managed Identity

By default, Azure Service Bus uses a connection string to create a connection to a specific Service Bus instance, queue or topic. While this approach works, the connection string has to be stored securely by the application, which creates a security risk, for example the connection string can be copied or accidentally checked into source control.

Service Bus supports Azure Role Base Access Control (RBAC), such that a Managed Identity can be granted a role to a Service Bus instance, queue or topic without the need for a connection string at all.

### Logic App Designer Considerations

Although the only permission we need to send messages to a Service Bus Topic is the *Service Bus Data Sender* role (directly against the topic), the Logic App Designer requires privileged permissions to configure the connection. The reason for this is the connector needs to iterate through the available queues and topics in the user interface to allow selection of the queue or topic to send to. This permission is only required when using the Logic Apps Designer - if we are using a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment, this is not required.

For our lab however, we need to configure the connection through the Logic Apps designer, so we need to add the *Contributor* role to the Logic App Managed Identity for the service bus namespace. Once the Logic App has been configured to use Managed Identity, and the topic has been selected, we can remove the *Contributor* role. We will also add the *Service Bus Data Sender* role to the *CreateOrder* topic at the same time.

### Add Contributor Role

Navigate to the Service Bus instance and select *Access Control (IAM)* then *Add Role Assignment*. Note this permission is being added at the Service Bus Namespace level, thus allowing the Logic App Service Bus connector to iterate through the queues and topics, as discussed.

Under the *Privileged Administrator Roles* select the *Contributor* role:

![Add Contributor Role](<images/Service Bus - Contributor Role.png>)

Click *Next*, then for *Assign access to*, select *Managed Identity*. Click *Select members*. Select the subscription, *Logic App* and select the Logic App created in the [first lab](<../Lab_1_LogicApp Setup/1.1 Create_LogicApp (Standard).md>). Click *Select* then *Review and Assign* (note you may need to click *Review and Assign* twice). 

### Add Service Bus Data Sender Role

Navigate to the *ContosoOrder* topic (that the *CreateOrder* Logic App is sending order messages to) then select *Access Control (IAM)* then *Add Role Assignment*.

Under the *Job Function Roles*, select the *Service Bus Data Sender* role:

![Add Role Assignment](<images/Service Bus - Add Role Assignment.png>)

Click *Next*, then for *Assign access to*, select *Managed Identity*. Click *Select members*. Select the subscription, *Logic App* and select the Logic App created in the [first lab](<../Lab_1_LogicApp Setup/1.1 Create_LogicApp (Standard).md>). Click *Select* then *Review and Assign* (note you may need to click *Review and Assign* twice).

Review the *Role Assignments* for the Service Bus Namespace and the *CreateOrder* topic to ensure the roles just added are visible.


## Azure Logic App Configuration

Now the permission has been granted for the Logic App Managed Identity, we must configure the *ContosoOrder* Logic App to use Managed Identity to connect to Service Bus. We will configure this against the *ContosoOrder* Logic App deployed to Azure.


### Logic App Service Bus Action Configuration
Navigate to the *CreateOrder* workflow in the *Contoso_Order* Logic App deployed to Azure, and click the *Send To Order Topic* Service Bus action.

We now need to change the connection from the existing connection (using the connection string) to Managed Identity. Click *change connection*, then *Add New*:

![Add New Connection](<images/Workflow - Add New Connection.png>)

Configure the following values:
- Name - sbconnmi
- Authentication Type: Managed Identity
- Fully Qualified Namespace - set to the Service Bus *hostname*, found here on the overview page of the Azure Service Bus instance.

![Service Bus Hostname](<images/Service Bus Hostname.png>)

Once the connection is added, ensure the correct topic is selected, then save the workflow.

## Test the Workflow

Using our RestClient test, trigger the *CreateOrder* workflow in Azure and review the run history to check the action that sends to the Service Bus topic (Send to Order Topic) has succeeded and the FulfilOrder Logic App has also been triggered.

We can now remove the *Contributor* role from the Service Bus namespace as it is no longer needed. Remove the role and test again.

## Add Managed Identity to the FulfilOrder Logic App

As an additional lab, configure the *FulfilOrder* Logic App to use Managed Identity. This time however we will assign the *Service Bus Data Receiver* role to the Logic App Managed Identity as we are receiving messages. If we needed to send and receive, we would need to add both the *Service Bus Data Sender* and *Service Bus Data Receiver* roles.
