# Azure Service Bus

For our next lab, we will create an Azure Service Bus instance, then create a Topic we can send our order to. Other applications can then subscribe to that topic to receive a copy of the order message.

## Create a Service Bus Instance
From the Azure Portal, create a new Service Bus instance by clicking *Create a resource* from the top left menu. Search for Azure Service Bus:

![Create Service Bus](<images/Azure Portal - Create Service Bus.png>)

Click *Create* and configure the following settings:

- Resource Group - the resource group where Service Bus will be deployed
- Namespace - the name of the Service Bus instance
- Location - North Europe
- Pricing Tier - *Standard* as *Basic* does not support topics

Note there is a geo replication option, only available in premium. This allows messages to be replicated to another region, then failed over to in the event of a region failure.

Leave all other values at their defaults and click *Review and Create* then *Create*.

### Create a Service Bus Topic

While queues have only one message receiver at a time, a topic can deliver the same message to multiple receivers. For example, our order message if delivered to a topic could then be received by two separate applications, one that fulfils the order and the other that updates stock levels.

Navigate to the Service Bus instance in the Azure Portal, and under *Entities*, click *Topics*, then click *+ Topic*:

![Create Topic](<images/Service Bus - Create Topic.png>)

For the topic name, enter *ordertopic* and leave other values at their defaults. Note the *Message time to live*, which defines how long a message will exist in a topic preventing messages living forever.

The details should be as follows:

![Topic](<images/Service Bus - Topic Details.png>)

A topic must have at least one subscription, used to subscribe to messages from the topic. Once the topic has been created, click the topic then click *+ Subscription* as follows:

![Create Subscription](<images/Service Bus - Create Subscription.png>)

Name the subscription *ordertopicSubscription* and leave the other fields as defaults. Press *Create* to create the subscription.

## Logic App Service Bus Actions

Azure Logic Apps has a *built-in* Service Bus connector, meaning it is able to process messages at high scale and also connect over a virtual network to a Service Bus instance that is private. There are a number of actions available, including:

- Trigger workflows from queues and topics
- Send messages to queues and topics
- Create queues, topics and topic subscriptions
- Peek/Lock on queues and topics (ability to take out a lock on a message, read it and decide whether to keep the message or return it to the queue)
- Read message batches directly from queues and topics

### Send message to a Service Bus Topic

We will now add an action to our workflow to send a message to the topic just created (*ordertopic*). 

Instead of sending the order to service bus *after* writing to the SQL Database, we will execute both in parallel.

Below *Create Order in SQL*, click + and click *Add a parallel branch*, then search for *Service Bus*, then *Send Message*. The designer will first ask for the connection details:

- *Name* - *sbconn*
- *Authentication Type* - *Connection String*
- *Connection string* - navigate to the Service Bus instance in the Azure Portal, click *Settings*, then *Shared Access Policies*, then *RootManageSharedAccessKey*, then view the Primary Connection String (the string is hidden - click the show content button at the end of the string):

![Connection String](<images/Service Bus - Connection String.png>)

Once the connection has been created, rename the action to *Send To Order Topic*, then select the topic just created in the *Queue or Topic Name* dropdown.

Click *Advanced parameters* and select *Content* and *Content type*, which will be added as fields to the screen. Add *application/json* to the *Content type* field, then use the designer data picker to select the output of the *Create Internal Order* action for the content and *application/json* for the *Content-Type*. It should look as follows:

![Service Bus Send](<images/Workflow - SB Send.png>)

Close the action - the workflow should look as follows:

![Parallel Action](<images/Workflow - Parallel action (1).png>)

Although *Create Order in SQL* and *Send to Order Topic* are running in parallel, the *Response* action will only run after *Create Order in SQL*. To make the response action only run when *both* actions succeed, click the *Response* action and go to *Settings*.

Configure *Run After* by clicking *Select Actions* then *Send to Order Topic*. The workflow should now look as follows:

![Parallel Action](<images/Workflow - Parallel action (2).png>)

Run the Logic App locally and test using RESTClient. Review the run history to see if the *Send to Order Topic* action succeeded. 

The message can also be viewed in Service Bus by navigating to the service bus instance in the Azure Portal, click *Entities*, then *Topics*, then *ordertopic*. Under *Entities*, click *Subscriptions* and note *orderTopicSubscription* should have a message count of 1 or more.

To actually view the message, click *Service Bus Explorer*:

![Service Bus Explorer](<images/Service Bus - Explorer.png>)

When Service Bus Explorer loads, select the *ordertopicSubscription* and click *Refresh*. The subscription count should be 1 or more. Where *Peek Mode* is displayed, change this to *Receive Mode*, then click *Receive Messages*. When the next popup appears, set the *Receive mode* to *ReceiveAndDelete*. Click *Receive*.

The message(s) should be visible, including the message body:

![Service Bus Explorer - Read Messages](<images/Service Bus - Explorer Read Messages.png>)

Using *Receive* mode rather than *Peek* mode will ensure the message is actually read from the subscription, then deleted. If we use *Peek* mode, we can read the message, but it will be returned back to the queue

Deploy the updated Logic App to Azure and validate it works successfully. Note - make sure you update the application settings as a new setting for the Service Bus connection string has been created.
