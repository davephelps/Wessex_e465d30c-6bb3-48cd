# Deploy to Azure

So far, we have used Visual Studio Code to run our Logic App locally. We will now deploy the Logic App to Azure and test it works as expected, and view the run history and other configuration.

## Create a Logic Apps Plan

Note: one person can create the Logic Apps Plan and share amongst everyone, or create one per person - just be mindful of cost. The following process will create a plan *and* a Logic App.

We will now create a Logic Apps Plan in Azure. Navigate to the Azure Portal, and from the menu on the top left, select *Create a Resource* and search for *Logic App*. Click *create* and select *Workflow Service Plan*. Review the other types of Logic available, including Hybrid which allows the Logic App to run on a Kubernetes cluster which could be in another cloud or on-premises for example.

Select the *Workflow Service Plan*, then select the subscription we are deploying to, then select a common resource group as we will be sharing the plan across all Logic Apps we are creating.

This is an important point - a single Logic Apps plan is able to host *many* Logic Apps, increasing density and reducing cost.

For the Logic App name, make it something unique as it needs to be globally unique. For the Region select *North Europe*. Disable Zone redundancy.

Move onto *storage* and create a storage account. Use the default, or if creating a storage account from scratch make sure the storage account type is *other*, then leave networking with the defaults.

For monitoring, enable application insights, then *Create*.

This will create a Logic App plan and a Logic App (the logic app itself can be deleted afterwards or used to deploy to from Visual Studio Code).

Once deployed, either click *go to resource* or navigate to the resource group where the plan was created to view it.

### Deploy to Azure

Next, we will deploy our Logic App to Azure, using the plan just created. Verify you are logged into Azure in Visual Studio Code by navigating to the *Azure* icon on the left of Visual Studio Code, and viewing *Resources*. You should see the subscription you are logged into. Navigate into the subscription to see resources that exist.

To deploy our Logic App to Azure, right click anywhere in the project structure and select *Deploy to Logic App*, or press *CTRL + Shift + P* and select *logic app deploy*, then *Create new Logic App (Standard) in Azure (Advanced)*.

Enter the values as we go through the wizard:

- Name, enter a unique name as the Logic App needs to be globally unique
- Location - set to North Europe
- Hosting Plan - Workflow Standard
- Select a Windows App Service Plan - select the plan previously created
- Resource Group - set the resource group you have been allocated 
- Storage Account - create a new storage account
- Application Insights - create a new application insights resource

Visual Studio Code will then create the Logic App resource and storage account associated with the Logic App and deploy your workflow

Once the Logic App has been deployed, you may notice a popup that appears at the bottom right of the screen:

![Upload Settings](<images/VS Code - Upload Settings.png>)

Click *Upload Settings* then *No to all*. This will update all settings from your local environment to Azure, but will not overwrite any settings that exist already. For example, Logic Apps require a storage account when running in Azure, which is created as part of the deployment. VS Code will create an environment variable called *AzureWebJobStorage* and set it to the connection string of the storage account. When running locally, we are using a storage emulator *Azurite*. The *AzureWebJobStorage* setting in *local.settings.json* is set to *UseDevelopmentStorage=true*, so we don't want to overwrite the Azure setting.

Navigate to your newly created Logic App in Azure and review the Environment Variables under *settings*. You should see the settings created locally for the *url* and *url key*:

### View Workflows in Azure

To view the workflows we have deployed, navigate to your Logic App and select *Workflows* as follows.

![View Workflows](<images/Azure - View Workflows.png>)

If you click on the workflow, you should then be able to view the workflow in the visual designer.

### Test the Workflow in Azure

In order to test the workflow, we need to copy the url of the workflow. The url is under *Properties*, then *Workflow URL*.

Copy your existing RESTClient .http file into a new file, then update the URL to be the URL of the Logic App in Azure. Test the workflow runs as expected.

### View Run History

Now view the run history and see the execution, which is available under *Tools*.

Review the scale out options also, under *Settings* then *Scale Out*:

![Scale Out](<images/Azure - Scale Out.png>)

Logic Apps will scale from 1 to the *Maximum Burst* based on the volume of requests the workflow needs to process, for example HTTP requests or messages on a service bus queue.
