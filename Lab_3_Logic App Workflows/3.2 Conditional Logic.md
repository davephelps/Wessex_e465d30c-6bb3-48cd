# Conditional Logic

In this lab, we will add a condition to the workflow to check if the call to check the customer account was successful. If the lookup is successful, we will return a success response, but if it fails, we will return a message indicating the account does not exist.

As a reminder, the *Check Customer Exists* action returns the following payload:

```json
{
  "accountId": "9803",
  "success": true
} 
```

We need to add a condition to check if the *success* property in the json response is equal to true.

## Add a Condition

After the *Check Customer Exists* action, click + to add another action - select *Condition* (you can search for this in the search bar or navigate to *Control*). The designer will add a *Condition* action to the workflow, where we can specify our logical conditions and true/false actions. Before we do anything else, rename the condition action to something more meaningful, such as *Does Account Exist*.

The designer allows AND and OR conditions to be defined and a combination of both. Click *Choose a value* and click the lightning bolt to see the list of fields available:

![Dynamic Content](<images/workflow - condition dynamic content.png>)

You will notice that under *Check Customer Exists* we only see the *body*, *headers* and *status code*. Even though the API returns a JSON payload, the fields within the payload do not appear. This is because the API doesn't have an Open API Definition so the designer is not aware of the fields within the JSON response.

To resolve this, we can use the *Parse JSON* action, which allows us to specify a json schema for the *Check Customer Exists* action which will  make the fields within the JSON response available to us in the designer.

Leave the *Condition* action on the canvas, then after the *Check Customer Exists* HTTP action, click + then *Add an Action*. Search then select *Parse JSON* and rename to *Parse Customer Account Response*. 

For the content, select the *Body* from *Check Customer Exists*. We then need to provide a schema, but for ease we can use the response payload and *Use sample payload to generate schema* option to automatically generate the schema. The payload is as follows (this can also be viewed in the run history after a successful run):

```json
{
  "accountId": "2607",
  "success": true
}
```

The Parse JSON action should look as follows:

![Parse JSON](<images/workflow - parse json schema.png>)

We can now go back to our condition and use the values from the Parse JSON action. Click *Does Account Exist* then *choose value*. From here we can click the lightning bolt to view the list of available fields. This time, under *Parse Customer Account Response*, we can see the *accountId* and *success* fields:

![Condition Dynamic Content](<images/workflow - condition picker.png>)

Select *success* and for the value, enter *true*. The *Does Account Exists* condition should now look as follows:

![Condition](<images/workflow - condition final.png>)

## Update True and False Actions

Although we now have a condition action, the true and false branches don't do anything. We want the workflow to return the following response if the account exists:
```json

{
  "orderId": 55_1626,
  "status": "received",
  "timestamp": 2025-04-09T22:36:48.2477118Z,
  "accountId": 3546
}
```
We also want to return the following response if the account *does not* exist:

```json
{
  "orderId": 55_1626,
  "status": "no account"
}
```
We could add two response actions with the different payloads to each side of the condition, but it would be better if we could define a response for the success and false conditions and return a single response at the end of the workflow. For this, we can use a *variable* action.

Variables act in a similar way to variables in traditional coding languages such as C# and Java. We need to first initialise the variable, then update it in both places. Finally, we can reference the variable in the response action.

### Adding a Variable

The first thing to do is is initialise a variable after the trigger. Click + to add an action (after the request trigger), and search for *variable* in the list of action types. Select *Initialise variable* and rename it to *Response Variable*, then set the *name* to *responseVariable*. Leave the *value* as blank. It should look as follows:

![Initialise Variable](<images/workflow - init variable.png>)

Next, navigate to the True side of the *Does Account Exist* condition and click + to add an action. This time, use the *Set variable* action and rename it to *Set Success Response*. For the *Name* property, select the variable created earlier. For the *Value*, copy the body from the *Response* action and paste into the *Value* property.

We also want to update the variable to return the *accountId* returned by *Check Customer Exists*. To do this, in the *Value* property of the *Set Success Response* variable, add another field called *accountId*, but for the value, use the dynamic content to select *accountId* from the *Parse Customer Account Response* action.

The variable should look as follows:

![Set Variable](<images/workflow - set variable.png>)

We now need to update the *False* side of the condition to return a failure response:

Navigate to the *False* side of the condition and add a *Set variable* action and rename it to *Set Failed Response*. For the *Value*, create a payload that has two fields:

- orderId - use the picker to select *orderId* from the request body
- timestamp - use the utcnow() expression
- status - set to "no account"

The response variable should look as follows:

![Failure Response](<images/Workflow - failure response.png>)

Finally, we need to update the response action to just use the output of the variable rather than the payload we have currently. To do this, navigate to the response action and remove everything in the body, then use the picker to select the *responseVariable* variable.

The response action should look as follows:

![Response Action](<images/workflow - response from variable.png>)

Test the workflow and if an email address ending in contoso.com is used, we should see an account id returned in the response. If a different email is used, we should see the failure response.

A successful response should look as follows:

```json
{
  "orderId": "55_1626",
  "status": "received",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-08T18:01:35.2155722Z",
  "accountId": "7750"
} 
```
View the run history to review the path the workflow took for the different email addresses passed in, and review the inputs/outputs of the various actions.

For completeness, the workflow should now look as follows:
