# Call a REST API

In this lab we will update the CreateOrder workflow to call an existing REST API to check if the customer exists based on their email address.

As we go through the following labs, we'll be using the Visual Designer a lot more to build a workflow for an end to end integration, including calling out to a REST API, adding conditional logic and using the data picker to select fields from previous steps to use in subsequent steps. For example, if we call a REST API which returns an account id, we may want to use that account id in another step. The Visual Designer allows us to do this without writing any code.

## Create an HTTP Action
We will now update the workflow to call an *account* API to check if the account exists for the customer email address. Open the CreateOrder workflow and click + between the Request and Response actions. From the list of connectors available, select *HTTP*. Note we can also choose a swagger endpoint if we have an Open API definition. Change the name of the action to *Check Customer Exists*, then enter the following settings:

- URI - provided by your trainer
- Method - GET
- Headers - add a header called Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key and set the value to the key provided by the trainer

Note the subscription key is a sensitive value and shouldn't be hard coded into the workflow, rather it should be retrieved through configuration. We will cover this later.

We also have to pass the email address to the API as a *path parameter*, a common way for REST APIs to retrieve data. At the end of the URI, make sure there are two //, then click at the end of the URI (after the //) and select *Insert dynamic content*. From here select *email* from the request trigger (you may have to select *see more* to view the email address):

![Dynamic Content](<images/workflow - http dynamic content.png>)

Save the workflow. We have now configured an HTTP action to call a REST API, passing the email address as a parameter. 

Test the workflow as before with different email addresses. If the email address is from contoso.com, it will return an account number and a success response of *true*. View the workflow run in the run history (right click workflow.json and select *overview*). The *Check Customer Exists* action should now be visible in the run history. Clicking on *Check Customer Exists* will show the input and output data as follows:

![Run History](<images/workflow - run history (Check Customer Exists).png>)

Note the HTTP GET with the email address appended to the URL as a path parameter and note the response returned.
