# Application Configuration

In this lab we will explore how to reference configuration values from our local settings, rather than hard coding them directly into the workflow.

We will also explore Logic Apps *Parameters*, which also allow for more complex configuration to be managed.

## Add Configurtion for the HTTP Action

For the *Check Customer Exists* action, we have hard coded the URL and the subscription key directly into the workflow. To add these to our local configuration, edit the *local.settings.json*, which can be found in the Logic Apps project in the location below:

![Local Settings](<images/Logic App - local settings.png>)

Add the two values:

-    "accountApi" : "url provided by trainer",
-    "accountApiKey" : "key provider by trainer"

The *local.settings.json* file should be as follows:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
    "APP_KIND": "workflowapp",
    "WORKFLOWS_SUBSCRIPTION_ID": "",
    "accountApi" : "your url",
    "accountApiKey" : "your key"
  }
}
```
Now we have added the configuration values to our local settings, we can reference them from the HTTP action in the workflow. To do this, navigate to the *Check_Customer_Exists* action and remove the existing url up to */email*, then click the expression icon, and enter *appsetting('accountApi')* and click *Add*.

We need to do the same thing with the api key, but using *appsetting('accountApiKey')* instead. The action should look as follows:

![App Setting](<images/workflow - appsetting.png>)

Test the workflow to validate the values are being retrieved correctly from *local.settings.json*.

## Logic Apps Parameters

As mentioned above, there are two ways to manage configuration in Azure Logic Apps, app settings (local.settings.json) and *parameters*. The following shows where each can be used:

### App Settings
- Typically environment specific: Values can differ across environments (dev, test, prod), urls, secrets etc.
- Can be updated without re-deployment
- Security: can use KeyVault references
- Accessible via @appsetting('name') expressions throughout your workflow
- Single values - name/value pairs
- Native support in CI/CD pipelines, same as Functions and App Service
- Not typed, names do not appear in the designer

### Parameters
- Values can be simple or complex objects, for example an array of JSON objects
- Parameters are named, so appear in the visual designer and are easy to reference
- Type checking
- Can have default values
- Require deployment to update

We will now add two parameters we can reference from our workflow.

### Create Priority Variable
First, we will create a parameter called *priority* and set the value to *high*, then update the response to include it. Open the workflow in the designer and click the *Parameters* button at the top left of the workflow.

Click *Create Parameter* and add a parameter as follows:

- Name - *highPriority*
- Type - *string*
- Value - *high*

Make sure on the *Set Success Response* and *Set Failure Response*, the *timestamp*, *orderId* and *accountId* all have strings around the values. For example:

![Set Resoponse](<images/Workflow - set response.png>)

We now want to add an additional field to our response called *priority* and set it to the value contained in the variable.

Navigate to the *Response* action, clear the body, and click the expression icon. Enter the following:
```c#
addProperty(json(variables('responseVariable')),'priority',parameters('highPriority'))
```
This is using the *addProperty* expression to add a property to an existing JSON object and then returns the updated object. See [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/workflow-definition-language-functions-reference#addProperty) for more details.


Note, when adding an expression, you can switch between the dynamic and expression views. For example, enter *addProperty(json(* then switch to the dynamic view to select the variable called *responseVariable*. Switch back to the expression view to enter *'priority'*, then back to the dynamic view to select the *highPriority* variable.

Test the workflow and verify the response now contains the priority field:

```json
{
  "status": "received",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-11T11:49:08.0308663Z",
  "orderId": "55_1626",
  "accountId": "3855",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

### Complex Parameters

Parameters can also be complex objects, such as arrays. We will now add a parameter containing a list of title lookups and use this to transform the title passed in to a lookup value in the array.

### Title Lookup

Create a parameter called *titleList* of type *Array* and paste in the following as the value:

[{"name":"Mr","value":"Mister"},{"name":"Dr","value":"Doctor"},{"name":"Prof","value":"Professor"},{"name":"Rev","value":"Reverend"}]

We then need to search for the title in the list and return the value, which can be done using the *Filter array* action. Click + after the *Parse Customer Account Response* action, and add an action of type *Filter array*. Name it *Query Title List*.

The filter array action takes an array as a parameter, then uses a condition to search the array. In our case, we are searching the *TitleList* parameter, which can be found in the dynamic picker.

Then, for the Filter Query, click the expression icon, and enter the following:

```c#
item().name
```

item() is a reference to each row in the array allowing us to use *name* as the value to filter on.

For the condition, select *is equal to* then use the picker to select *title* from the request. It should look as follows:

![Filter](<images/Workflow - Filter.png>)

Test the workflow and view the run history to see if the filter action has returned a single row that has *mr* and *mister*.

We can then create a new message that contains the updated title. After *Query Title List*, add a *Compose* action and name it *Create Account Message*, then add the following expression:

```c#
setProperty(body('Check_Customer_Exists'),'title', first(body('Query_Title_List')).value)
```

The *setProperty* expression updates a property and returns the updated object. As before, switch between expression and dynamic mode to use the picker. Details on setProperty can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/workflow-definition-language-functions-reference#setproperty)

Test the workflow and verify the *title* field has been updated.
