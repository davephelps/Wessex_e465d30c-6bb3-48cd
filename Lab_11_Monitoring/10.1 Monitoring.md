# Monitoring Logic Apps
There are a number of ways to monitor Azure Logic Apps including the detailed run history we see from the Run History. We can however also make use of *Insights*, a feature that gives an overview of runs over time, or Application Insights for distributed monitoring across services.


## Logic Apps Insights
*Insights* are only available in the Azure Portal so only apply to deployed Logic Apps. Insights provide an overview of the health of the Logic App and statistics of executions, successes and failures over time.

Navigate to your deployed Logic App and to the *Monitoring* section of the menu on the left. The overview section shows a summary of execution over the time period selected, for example:

![Insights](<images/Logic App - Insights Overview.png>)

Click on *Workflows*, *Runs* and *Compute* to see more details.

# Monitoring with Application Insights

Azure Logic Apps have rich insights through the *Run History* and *Insights* we have been using so far. The scope of *Run History* however is just Logic Apps and dependencies.

## Correlation
Application Insights is an Azure service that can span multiple different systems and platforms, for example Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, Azure API Management or custom APIs and services. When a service makes a call to another service, it injects a correlation header which allows the second service to join into the end-to-end trace. Application Map (a feature of Application Insights) shows how services interact with each other at runtime. For example, here is an end to end view of a request that flows from Azure API Management to a Logic App, which writes to a queue, which is then processed by an Azure Function, which writes to a queue, which is picked up by another Azure Function:

## Create an Application Insights Instance
When a Logic App is created through the Azure Portal, or when deployed through Visual Studio Code, an instance of Application Insights can be created. If you created Application Insights when deploying your Logic App in previous labs, skip this section.

Navigate to the Azure Portal and create an Application Insights resource (click the menu option on the top left to create a resource, then search for Application Insights). 

An Application Insights resource would usually span more than one service, but is scoped to a project or set of related integrations. For this reason it is beneficial to create the instance in a separate resource group so it is not accidentally deleted.

## Enable Application Insights for Azure Logic Apps Standard

*Application Insights is supported in Azure Logic Apps Standard and not Consumption Logic Apps.*

We will now add Application Insights support to the CreateOrder Logic App, created in [Lab 1](<../Lab_1_LogicApp Setup/1.1 Create_LogicApp (Standard).md>).
To enable Application Insights, we need to add a setting to *local.settings.json* when running locally and *Environment Variables* when deployed to Azure.

### Enable Application Insights - Visual Studio Code
The setting we need to add to local.settings.json is called *APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING* and needs to be set to the connection string of the Application Insights instance created in the Azure Portal. Navigate to the instance, and copy the *Connection String*, as follows:

![Connection String](<images/Application Insights - Connection String.png>)

We also need to update host.json with the following settings (the key entry is the *workflow* setting):

``` json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "logging": {
    "applicationInsights": {
      "samplingSettings": {
        "isEnabled": true,
        "excludedTypes": "Request"
      }
    }
  },
  "extensionBundle": {
    "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Workflows",
    "version": "[1.*, 2.0.0)"
  },
  "extensions": {
    "workflow": {
      "Settings": {
        "Runtime.ApplicationInsightTelemetryVersion": "v2",
        "Runtime.ApplicationInsights.PreserveIncomingOperationId": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Run the workflow locally through our RestClient test, then navigate to the Azure Portal and to the Application Insights instance configured for the Logic App. The *Overview* page shows some basic details, such as the number of requests received and whether they have succeeded or not.

### Enable Application Insights - Azure Portal
If the Logic App is deployed with the APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING setting already configured, it will be created in Azure as an environment variable and no action needs to be taken. If however Application Insights has not been configured, this can be done in two ways.

- Navigate to Environment Variables (under *Settings*) and add a new variable called *APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING* and set it to the connection string in the same way we did for the local settings
- Navigate to Monitoring then to Application Insights where the Application Insights can be selected through the Azure Portal. This will update the *APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING*.


### Application Map
A very useful feature of Application Insights is *Application Map*, which shows dependencies between applications and services at *runtime*. Navigate to *Investigate* then to *Application Map*. It should look similar to below:

![Application Map](<images/Application Insights - Application Map (Contoso).png>)

Each node displayed represents a service enabled for Application Insights and its dependencies, for example Azure Service Bus, SQL or API Management. If the service or dependency has failed, it should be highlighted in red, for example:

![Application Map with Failures](<images/Application Insights - Application Map with Failures.png>)

To force a failure, edit the *CreateOrder* workflow and change the stored procedure name to one that doesn't exist, then trigger the workflow. Click the node in Application Map and *View Details* as follows:

![Application Map Exception Details](<images/Application Insights - Application Map Exception Details.png>)

Application Insights will then show an option to *Investigate Failures* where Application Insights will show the top exception codes and types:

![Exception Details](<images/Application Insights - Exception Details.png>)

Click the top response codes to drill into the details and click the suggested entry, which then shows the full end to end correlation and exception:

![Full Exception](<images/Application Insights - Full Exception.png>)

## Logs
As workflows execute, an entry is written to Application Insights for the trigger and every action that executes. This is true for both stateful and stateless workflows. The workflow name, whether it was successful or not, duration etc. are all logged. 

Application Insights contains a number of tables (much like SQL tables) where data is written to:
- requests - where workflow triggers and action execution are written
- exceptions - where failures are written
- dependencies - where workflow dependencies are written, for example if the workflow is writing to Service Bus, an entry will appear in this table 

While the Application Insights user interface provides a rich user experience, it's useful to be able to view the raw data and structure it for a specific purpose.

Navigate to your Application Insights instance, and under *Monitoring*, select *Logs*. The default page (Queries Hub) has a number common pre-built queries, for example summarising performance of failures over time, useful to see if actions are degrading in performance.

Close the Queries Hub to view the Query Editor. The Query Editor has two modes - *Simple* and *KQL*. In simple mode there is no need to write queries from scratch. For example, to view the *requests* table, click the table icon on the top left and select *requests*:

![Application Insights Logs](<images/Application Insights - Logs (simple mode).png>)

We should see all actions executed in the requests table:
![Simple Mode](<images/Application Insights - Logs (simple mode view).png>)

In KQL Mode, we can write queries, for example:

``` sql
requests |
order by timestamp desc
```
This will show all triggers and actions executed over the time period selected.

## Application Insights - Live Metrics
Another great feature of Application Insights is *Live Metrics* which allows a live, instant view of how the Logic App and any other services are running, including scale out behaviour. Navigate to your Application Insights instance and under *Investigate* select *Live Metrics*, for example:

![Live Metrics](<images/Application Insights - Live Metrics.png>)

Remember, Application Insights can be applied across a number of different applications and services, so the graphs will apply to all. To filter on a specific service, change the *Role* - you should see your deployed Logic App in the list.

Note also *Servers* at the bottom of the page, which shows the number of running instances. If the Logic App scales out, the number of instances will increase, so it's a really easy way of to see how Logic Apps are scaling in realtime.

# Application Insights - Best Practice
Care should be taken to ensure Application Insights are configured correctly:

- An instance of Application Insights should span an application or set of related integrations. It is not recommended to have a single instance across non related applications or integrations. This could lead to data being visible where it is not intended and also reaching throttling limits for the Application Insights service
- For Azure Functions and Logic Apps, validate that the Traces table is required as a lot of runtime detail is written to this table. Through configuration of host.json (same for Logic Apps and Functions) runtime data can be sampled, thus reducing the amount of data written. Sampling should be used where a representative view of the logs is required
- Tables can also be excluded from monitoring completely, for example *traces*
- Application Insights Workspaces can also have a daily cap, thus reducing cost when a specific limit is reached. Care should be taken enabling this as important logs could be lost when the cap is met. Within any solution, there may be some services where their logs are more important than others, so in these cases consider using sampling, excluding tables or even more than one instance of Application Insights such that the cap can be configured differently. See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/daily-cap) for details on setting a daily cap
