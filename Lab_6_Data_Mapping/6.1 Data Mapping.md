# Data Mapping

So far we have used the *Compose* action to create new messages with a combination of expressions and the visual designer data picker. Logic Apps also has a visual mapping tool we can use to create new messages from JSON to JSON, XML to XML, JSON to XML and XML to JSON.

**Note:** The Data Mapper is currently in **public preview** so a few issues may be encountered. For example, there are no scrollbars on the schema view (this is being resolved).

Make sure the data mapper version is set to 2 in the Azure Logic Apps extension settings. To navigate to the extension settings, click the *Extensions* icon on the far left of VS Code, then click *Logic Apps Standard*. From here, we can then click the gear icon to go to settings, as follows:

![Extension Settings](<images/Data Mapper - extension settings.png>)

The setting is automatically saved.

## Create Order Summary

As a reminder, our order request message has an array of orders:

``` json
  "orderDetails": 
  [
      {
          "quantity": "3",
          "price" : "20.00",
          "priority": "2",
              "productDetails": {
                  "productID": "123",
                  "category": "Accessories",
                  "name": "Microsoft Arc Mouse",
                  "colour": "Green"
              }
      },
      {
          "quantity": "1",
          "price" : "1400.00",
          "priority": "1",
              "productDetails": {
                  "productID": "123",
                  "category": "Laptops",
                  "name": "Microsoft Surface Pro 4",
                  "colour": "Titanium"
              }
      }
  ]
  ```

We want to create a map to create a new message that includes the *accountId*, *quantity*, *price*, *productID* and a new field, *orderTotal* which is the *quantity* multiplied by *price*. We then want to set two additional fields at the end of the message:

- totalOrderCount - sum of all *quantity* field across all orders
- totalOrderValue - sum of all *total* fields to include a sum of each order total

We also want to update a field called *customerFullName* that is the *title*, *forenames* and *surname* added together.

For example the output message would look as follows:

``` json
{
  "orderId": "55_1626",
  "accountId" : "12345",
  "customerFullName": "Mr Phil Brewster",
  "orderDetails": 
  [
      {
          "quantity": "3",
          "price" : "20.00",
          "productID": "123",
          "orderTotal": "60.00"
      },
      {
          "quantity": "1",
          "price" : "1400.00",
          "productID": "678",
          "orderTotal": "1400.00"
      }
  ],
  "totalOrderQuantity": "4",
  "totalOrderValue": "1580.00"
}

```

There is a schema in the repo to represent the new message called *internalOrderDest.json*. Copy this schema and the *internalOrderSource.json* schema from the repo [here](<../Common Files/schemas>) to to the Visual Studio Code project under *Artifacts/Schemas*:

![Artifacts Folder](<images/Data Mapper - schemas folder.png>)


### Create Data Map
Create a new data map by clicking the *Azure* extension then clicking *Create data map* under *Data Mapper* and name it *CreateInternalOrder*

![Create Map](<images/Data Mapper - create map.png>)

For the source schema, make sure *Select Existing* is  selected, then select *internalOrderSource.json*. For the destination schema, select *internalOrderDest.json*

The mapper allows fields to be dragged from the source to destination schemas, but also for *functions* to be used to perform actions such as summary or concatenation.

Perform the following actions:

- orderId - drag from the source to destination
- accountId - drag from source (under *account*) to the destination. Search for *accountId* in the search box at the top of the source schema 
- under orderDetails, drag *quantity*, *price* and *productID* to the destination

To create the orderTotal, drag (or click) a *Multiply* function (found under *Math*) to the canvas, then drag *quantity* and *price* to the *Multiply* action. Then drag from the *Multiply* action to the *orderTotal* field on the destination. It should look as follows:

![Multiple](<images/Data Mapper - Multiply.png>)

Press *Save* (top left) which will save the map and also generate an XSLT file. We can test our work so far by clicking *Open test panel* (top left) and pasting our request payload into the *Sample data* box and clicking *Test*. Copy and paste the following payload to the test input box:

``` json
{
  "order": {
    "orderId": "55_1627",
    "forenames": "Phil",
    "surname": "Brewster",
    "title": "Mr",
    "contactDetails": {
      "mobile": "0777777777",
      "home": "01111222222",
      "email": "dave@ebrd.com"
    },
    "deliveryAddress": {
      "houseNumber": "2",
      "streetName": "Lake View",
      "town": "Cheltenham",
      "postCode": "GL51AAA",
      "country": "UK"
    },
    "orderDetails": [
      {
        "quantity": "3",
        "price": "20.00",
        "priority": "2",
        "productDetails": {
          "productID": "123",
          "category": "Accessories",
          "name": "Microsoft Arc Mouse",
          "colour": "Green"
        }
      },
      {
        "quantity": "1",
        "price": "1400.00",
        "priority": "1",
        "productDetails": {
          "productID": "123",
          "category": "Laptops",
          "name": "Microsoft Surface Pro 4",
          "colour": "Titanium"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "account": {
    "accountId": "2860",
    "success": true,
    "title": "Mister"
  }
}
```

![Test Map](<images/Data Mapper - test map.png>)

The mapped fields should be present in the result, including the *orderTotal* field.

### Concatenating Fields
We will now create the *customerFullName* field. Drag (or click) a *concat* function (found under String) to the canvas, then drag the *title* (from account), *forenames* and *surname* fields to the *concat* action. If we left this as it is, it would simply create a string containing all three fields with no spaces. To add a space between each field, click the *concat* action, then click *Add input* and add a space in double quotes (" "). Drag the space to just below *title* by clicking and dragging the two parallel lines on the right hand side. Add another space and drag to just after *forenames*. It should look as follows:

![Concat](<images/Data Mapper - concat.png>)

We then need to attach the output of the *concat* action to the *customerFullName* field. We can do this by either clicking the *Output* tab, and selecting *customerFullName* (which may already be selected) or closing the *concat* function and dragging the output to the *customerFullName* field.

Test the map and verify the *customerFullName* field is populated correctly:

![Concat Test Output](<images/Data Mapper - concat output.png>)

### Summarising from an Array

Finally, we will summarise the total order quantity and values from all order items in the array.

Navigate to the *Collection* functions and drag *Sum* onto the canvas, then drag the output of the *Multiply* function to the *Sum* action. Then, under *orderDetails*, drag *\<ArrayItem\>* to the *Sum* function.

Clicking the *Sum* function should show the following:

![Sum](<images/Data Mapper - sum settings.png>)

 Note the collection is set to *multiply(quantity,price)* and the *scope* is set to *\<ArrayItem\>*. When working with collections we always need to set the scope to be the array we want to use. Drag the output of the *Sum* function to *totalOrderValue*.

We now want to create a sum of the order quantities. Drag another *Sum* from *Collection* to the canvas, then drag the *Quantity* field and *\<ArrayItem\>* to the new *Sum* function. Drag the output of *Sum* function to the *totalOrderQuantity* field on the destination schema.

It should look as follows (note you can drag the functions to make the use of space on the canvas):

![Sum](<images/Data Mapper - sum overview.png>)

Test the map and verify the *totalOrderValue* and *totalOrderQuantity* are returned correctly:

![Test Map Final](<images/Data Mapper - test map final.png>)

### Test from the Logic App Workflow

The Data Mapper automatically generates an XSLT 3.0 file, which it writes to the *Maps* folder.

We will now use the map in our Logic App Workflow and validate it is working correctly. After the *Does Account Exist* condition, click "+" to add a new action. Select (or search) *Transform using Data Mapper XSLT*:

![Data Mapper](<images/Workflow - Data Mapper.png>)

Name the mapper action *Create Internal Order* and select *CreateInternalOrder* for the *Map Name* and for *Content*, we need to create a new message that contains the request payload (the trigger), and the message created in *Create Account Message*. Create a property called *order* that contains the request body, and *account* that contains the message created in *Create Account Message*. The body should look as follows:

![Data Mapper](<images/Workflow - Data Mapper Settings.png>)

Test the workflow, then in the Run History, view the *Create Internal Order* message action to see the output of the map, then click *Show raw outputs* to see the actual JSON message:

``` json
{
    "body": {
        "orderId": "55_1626",
        "accountId": "9656",
        "customerFullName": "Mister Phil Brewster",
        "orderDetails": [
            {
                "quantity": "3",
                "price": "20.00",
                "productID": "123",
                "orderTotal": "60"
            },
            {
                "quantity": "1",
                "price": "1400.00",
                "productID": "123",
                "orderTotal": "1400"
            }
        ],
        "totalOrderQuantity": "4",
        "totalOrderValue": "1460"
    }
}
```
